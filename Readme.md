Create a simple Yeoman project using Bourbon & Neat. Set up a basic page that is in line with - http://neat.bourbon.io/examples/. I'm looking to make sure you understand how to include Neat on your page and make sure you understand how Neat works with layout. It does not need to be responsive, but bonus points for those that can figure it out :)
